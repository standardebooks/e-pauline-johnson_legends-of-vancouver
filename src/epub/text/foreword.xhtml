			<h2 epub:type="title">Foreword</h2>
			<p>I have been asked to write a preface to these Legends of Vancouver, which, in conjunction with the members of the Publication Subcommittee⁠—<abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Lefevre, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">L. W.</abbr> Makovski and <abbr>Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R. W.</abbr> Douglas⁠—I have helped to put through the press. But scarcely any prefatory remarks are necessary. This book may well stand on its own merits. Still, it may be permissible to record one’s glad satisfaction that a poet has arisen to cast over the shoulders of our grey mountains, our trail-threaded forests, our tide-swept waters, and the streets and skyscrapers of our hurrying city, a gracious mantle of romance. Pauline Johnson has linked the vivid present with the immemorial past. Vancouver takes on a new aspect as we view it through her eyes. In the imaginative power that she has brought to these semi-historical sagas, and in the liquid flow of her rhythmical prose, she has shown herself to be a literary worker of whom we may well be proud: she has made a most estimable contribution to purely Canadian literature.</p>
